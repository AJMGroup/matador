- High-throughput and automation

- Analysis: reproducible plots

# Acknowledgements

M.E. would like to acknowledge the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Computational Methods for Materials Science for funding under grant number EP/L015552/1. Much of the development and testing was performed on the Cambridge Service for Data Driven Discovery (CSD3) operated by the University of Cambridge Research Computing Service (http://www.csd3.cam.ac.uk/), provided by Dell EMC and Intel using Tier-2 funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and DiRAC funding from the Science and Technology Facilities Council (www.dirac.ac.uk).
