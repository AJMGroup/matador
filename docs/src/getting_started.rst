Getting Started
===============

After successfully `installing <https://matador-db.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_, we can now try to do some science!

When running matador from the command line for the first time, you will be prompted to create a `.matadorrc` config file. This allows you to point to the MongoDB instance you want to use, or set up default plotting options. Alternatively, you can create your own `.matadorrc` based on the default found `here <https://bitbucket.org/ml-evs/matador/src/matador/config/matadorrc.yml>`_.

You should now be able to follow the example Jupyter notebooks found in the `examples folder <https://bitbucket.org/ml-evs/matador/src/matador/examples>`_ which have been hosted `here <https://matador-db.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>`_.
